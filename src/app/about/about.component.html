    <p>
      I'm passionate about chess, technology, and teaching. I believe the logic and strategy of chess
      complement the world of software development beautifully. Through my blog, I share my journey as a frontend developer and a competitive chess player — and how those worlds connect.

    <p>
      I love experimenting with AI in chess training and using Angular to build interactive and elegant web applications.
